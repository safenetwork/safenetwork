# Contributing to the SAFE Network

:tada: Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SAFE Network! :tada:

The SAFE Network is a decentralized data storage and communications network that provides a secure, efficient and low-cost infrastructure for everyone.

This documents is a set of guidelines for contributing to the SAFE Network. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to abuse@safenetwork.org.

## What we're working on

The best way to follow our progress is to read the [MaidSafe Dev Updates](https://safenetforum.org/c/development/updates), which are published every week (on Thursdays) on the [SAFE Network Forum](https://safenetforum.org/).

Our immediate development focus (Alpha 2) is to provide Mutable Data and authenticator pattern (with the new SAFE API), SAFE Browser DOM APIs and Node.js SDK along with example apps, tutorials and documentation. This new data type and API paradigm is specifically catered for mobile platform support.

See our [Development Roadmap](https://maidsafe.net/roadmap_dev.html) for more information on our near term development focus.

## How you can contribute

- Build a SAFE app based on one of [these example apps](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_examples/tree/dev). Try to improve the user interface and add new features! For example, you could build a messaging app based on the [SAFE Mail Tutorial](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_examples/tree/dev/email_app), a website editor/publisher based on the [SAFE Markdown Editor](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_examples/tree/dev/markdown_editor) or an app to browse and manage private files based on the [SAFE Hosting Manager](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_examples/tree/dev/web_hosting_manager).

- Build your own SAFE app! :smiley: See [these issues](https://github.com/safenetwork/safenetwork/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aapps) for some app ideas.

- Give us your feedback on the new SAFE API (e.g. write a post on the [SAFE Dev Forum](https://forum.safedev.org/)).

- Make client libraries for languages we don't support yet (e.g. Python, Ruby, Go, C#, etc.). See [these issues](https://github.com/safenetwork/safenetwork/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22client+libraries%22) for more info.

- Help us write documentation, tutorials and hello world example apps.

- Help us spread the word to other developers! (e.g. write a blog post, give a talk about the SAFE Network, organize a meetup, etc.)

## Communication channels

The [SAFE Dev Forum](https://forum.safedev.org/) is the main discussion forum of the **SAFE Network developer community**. It's a good place to discuss the core libraries and APIs of the SAFE Network. Furthermore, we have the [SAFE Network Forum](https://safenetforum.org/) for the wider community (end users and developers).

We also have a Matrix chat room ([#safenetwork-dev:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#safenetwork-dev:matrix.org)) where you can talk with other SAFE Network developers. Itâ€™s bridged with [#safenetwork-dev](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/safenetwork-dev) on freenode and [safenetwork.slack.com](https://slack.safenetwork.org/).
