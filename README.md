# SAFE Network

The SAFE Network is a decentralized data storage and communications network that provides a secure, efficient and zero-cost infrastructure.

Rather than using data centers and servers which are prone to data theft and surveillance, the SAFE Network uses advanced peer-to-peer technology that joins together the unused hard drive space, CPU power and Internet connections of all SAFE users, creating a global network.

Users of the SAFE Network have full control over their data, while app developers can focus their time building on top of a secure infrastructure.
